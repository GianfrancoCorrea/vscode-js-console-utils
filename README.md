## Usage

With selection:
* Highlight a variable (or really any text)
* Press Cmd+Shift+L
* The output (on a new line) will be: console.log('variable: ', variable);

Without selection:
* Press Cmd+Shift+L
* The output (on the same line) will be: console.log();

To remove console.logs:
* Press Cmd+Shift+D

## To Do
* Add support for other console.* methods (warn, error, time, timeEnd, etc)

* ~~When deleting console.*, report how many were deleted~~, across how many files
* Allow configuration to only delete certain types of console.* statements
